# WAST_Reconfig

Reconfiged stock and some mod parts for more realism. Recommended to use with Kerbin365 (3.2x planets, 6.4x orbital dist.), since some rocket engines will be a bit overpowered. If you're an atmosphereic guy, you should be good either way.

– FEATURES – 
Rebalances
- Reduced jets' specific impulses
- Reduced most jets' operating speed
- Reduced altitude of operations of jets
- Increased some jets' thrust
- Splitted JX-4 Turbo Ramjet into two different engine modules (turbofan and ramjet)
- Reduced ion thruster's specific impulse
- Many engines now have the capabilities of combusting LH2 (not yet)
- Engine Precoolers now produces PrecooledLOX from intakeAir
- Air breathing mode of the RAPIER engine uses PrecoooledLOX as oxidizer instead of intakeAir
- The Mk2 Scramjet in OPT now uses LH2 as fuel, also oxygen-rich combustion will be available (not released yet, more testings to be done)
- S1 KD-25k Kickback SRB now has a thrust curve relative to fuel level and a gimbal has been added
- More to come

Parts
- Added a small SRB mimicking the IUS
- Components of an active liquid-cooling cycle (not yet)
- An Mk2 sized engine precooler (needs more testings)



– WIP FEATURES – 
- More LF-OX engine rebalances
- Battery rebalances
- Supports for mods
